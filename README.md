## Why This Project?

I chose this project because I wanted to challenge myself by building an e-commerce website, something I’ve never done before. The course I'm following has given me the confidence to try something outside my comfort zone, and I’m eager to learn more about how to create dynamic, user-friendly online shopping experiences.

## Future Improvements

In future iterations, I plan to:
- Add user accounts for tracking orders.
- Implement a rating and review system for products.
- Enhance the checkout process with payment gateway integration.
